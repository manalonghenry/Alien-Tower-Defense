Known Bugs
- I know of one known bug which is that sometimes I have to double press 'O' for colored tiles to show up. Specifically, this happesn when pressing 'O' on the drawing screen, then pressing 'P' to play, and then pressing 'P' to go back to the drawing screen. Then you have to double press 'O' in order to see the colored tiles again.
- Repeatedly pressing R will result in the points to continuously decrease until an eventual victory screen
